image:steve.png[float="right",align="left"] Greetings, spinning blue world. My name is Steve. I’m a software technical writer. This site is a sandbox where I test things I am learning or showcase work I have done. Here I will _gradually_ post experiments with HTML 5, animation, static site generation, lightweight markup, Scrivener, articles about sustainable living and other subjects that interest me or aid in my xref:site-home:ROOT:resume.adoc[work].

I created this site using https://antora.org[Antora^], the static site generator for xref:jamstack:asciidoc:about-asciidoc.adoc[AsciiDoc] files. See xref:jamstack:antoras:why-antora-is-awesome.adoc[Antora is awesome].

My goal is to become proficient with web design. I can't master every technology of the web. But I can achieve professional results by focusing on key technologies that mesh beautifully--AsciiDoc and Antora, for example. This site, where I do what I’m not paid to…is the means to that end. In fact, _this entire site is a demo_, to demonstrate that non-trivial websites can be created from AsciiDoc text files, freeing writers like me to focus on content development, using the xref:jamstack:ROOT:docs-as-code.adoc[docs-as-code] approach.

Why did I name this site [text-info]`never until now`? I’m self taught. Studying a little each day pays off. Never until now could I be this creative or productive. By creating this site, I hope to leave tidbits of lessons learned for similarly minded people, while I:

*   Learn by doing
*   Host content I’ve created
*   Share what I am learning and thinking

No doubt about it, the subject matter here is incomplete, unpolished, or intended for the convenience of the site author. But feel free to look around. In the midst of my unfinished, experimental, and partially understood notions, I'll try to leave a few scattered gems of experience. Make yourself at home. I’m glad you’re here. If anything sparks your interest, mailto:neveruntilnow@gmail.com[feel free to comment]. Point me in new directions. Share what you’ve learned on your journey. Let’s light the way forward. It’s all good.
