= Couchbase Tabs Extension Example
:tabs:

This page shows how to implement tab pages using the tabs-block.js extension at https://github.com/couchbase/docs-site/blob/master/lib/tabs-block.js.

It extends the AsciiDoc syntax to support a tabset. The tabset is created from a definition list enclosed in an example block that is marked with the tabs style.

For instructions, see https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/tabs.html.

== What I did to implement this

. I copied *tabs-block.js* from the couchbase website.
. I added an entry for *tabs-block.js* to my playbook:
. I downloaded Dan Allen's tabs-block extension. For some reason, behavior.js and extension.js throw errors when added to the extensions seciton of my playbook, so I commented those out.
. I copied Dan Allen's *styles.css* to the source/css folder in my experimental UI bundle.
. I appended @import *"styles.css";* to site.css.
. I packed the ui bundle.
. Generated the site.
